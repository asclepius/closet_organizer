# Bedroom Closet Organizer

This is a hacked together closet organizer... rough draft with variables strewn about in odd places.

## Semiautomatic Bill of Materials

I was planning on making this out of fancy veneered plywood so I wanted a quick way to estimate cost.  I added a little bom.sh script that can be experiment with to tell you how many of each part to cut.  The bill of materials does not include hardware.

To accomplish this I just added "echo" statements to the modules so that each time they are instantiated they spit out their dimensions.
